**NB. break it down. Aim to do half the work for half the money or less as a coherant intro**

A few pointers on how to start with a project and what questions to ask

- What does tomorrow look like? What happens when this is all finished
- What is the value of the solution? Aim to be an investment not a cost. 
- focus on why, why now? 

A few things to clarify
- Websites not free or cheap to run
